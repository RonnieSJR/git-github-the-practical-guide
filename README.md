# Git and GitHub Practical Guide - Learning Repository

This repository contains my projects, exercises, and notes from the 'Git - Github: Practical Guide' course on Udemy. It serves as a practical demonstration of my learning journey in version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

## Key Features

- Hands-on projects showcasing Git and GitHub usage
- Notes on important concepts and commands
- Real-world application of version control principles

This repository not only documents my progress but also serves as a reference for future projects and collaboration.
